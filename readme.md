# Heart Attack Analysis in Germany

This project analyzes heart attack data in Germany, focusing on the comparison between youth and adult populations. It aims to answer the following key questions:

* Between youth and adults, who are more prone to cardiac arrests?
* Within each age group, which gender is most prone to cardiac arrests?
* What is the evolution of heart attacks over time (increase or decrease)?
* Are smokers more at risk of heart attacks?
* Are diabetics more at risk of heart attacks?
* What are the states with the highest incidence of cardiac arrests?
* Does an individual's income level influence their risk of heart attacks?

## Data

## Results 

* **Age Group:** Adults are slightly more prone to heart attacks than youth.
* **Gender:** There isn't a significant difference between genders within each age group. Although for adults, males seem to have a higher risk than females.
* **Time Trend:** There isn't a clear upward or downward trend in heart attacks over the years between 2015 and 2023.
* **Smoking:** Smokers are more at risk of heart attacks compared to non-smokers.
* **Diabetes:** Diabetics have a considerably higher risk of heart attacks compared to non-diabetics.
* **Alcohol Consumption:** There seems to be no significant correlation between heart attack risk and alcohol consumption categories (low, medium, high, unknown).
* **Socioeconomic Status:** Socioeconomic status doesn't appear to be a major factor influencing heart attack risk.
* **Diet Quality:** Poor diet quality appears to be a contributing factor to heart attacks.
* **Urban vs Rural:** There isn't a significant difference in heart attack risk between urban and rural areas.

## Conclusions

This analysis of heart attack data in Germany between youth and adults yielded several key insights:

* **Age Group:** While both age groups are susceptible, adults are slightly more prone to heart attacks than youth.
* **Gender:** There isn't a significant difference between genders within each age group. Although for adults, males seem to have a higher risk than females.
* **Time Trend:** There isn't a clear upward or downward trend in heart attacks over the years between 2015 and 2023.
* **Smoking:** Smokers are more at risk of heart attacks compared to non-smokers.
* **Diabetes:** Diabetics have a considerably higher risk of heart attacks compared to non-diabetics.
* **Alcohol Consumption:** There seems to be no significant correlation between heart attack risk and alcohol consumption categories (low, medium, high, unknown).
* **Socioeconomic Status:** Socioeconomic status doesn't appear to be a major factor influencing heart attack risk.
* **Diet Quality:** Poor diet quality appears to be a contributing factor to heart attacks.
* **Urban vs Rural:** There isn't a significant difference in heart attack risk between urban and rural areas.
